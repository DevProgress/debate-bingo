### Technology
Debate bingo is a simple mobile web app built with Node.js on the server and React on the client.

### Tools
#### Prerequisites
* Node.js
* Git

#### Commands
To build, run

    npm run dev

This will build the app using WebPack and run a local server with a watch, so edits to JS and Sass files will trigger a rebuild.

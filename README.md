### Technology
Debate bingo is a simple mobile web app built with Node.js on the server and React on the client.

### Tools
#### Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/)

#### Commands
To build and watch, run

    npm run dev

This will build the app using WebPack and run a local server with a watch, so edits to JS and Sass files will trigger a rebuild.
